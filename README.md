Python Data Structures general build / description
In each py file I built a general structure for each data structure and added in depth explainations/descriptions of their attributes, methods, and overall function. I start with very basic executions of the data structures and build upon them. 

What's covered in each:

Classes 1: Class Instances and Instance variables

Classes 2: Class Variables


Linked List 1: Nodes, Prepending/Appending to list, Printing list, Removing first/last node of list. 

Linked List 2: Insertion/Removal of nodes at certain index/position of list
